Here are some tips:\n\n1. Know the risks: Familiarize yourself with the marine toxins present in the area you plan to visit. Common marine toxins include cyanide, tetrodotoxin, and pufferfish toxins.\n\n2. Stay informed: Check for weather forecasts, tide predictions, and marine conditions before heading out. This will help you avoid swimming in areas with high toxin levels.\n\n3. Wear appropriate gear: Wear a properly fitted and well-maintained wetsuit, which provides a barrier against toxins. Additionally, consider using a buoyancy control device, such as a weight belt, to help you maintain a safe depth.\n\n4. Avoid eating seafood: Avoid consuming raw or undercooked seafood, as it can contain harmful toxins. Instead, opt for cooked or properly prepared seafood.\n\n5. Be cautious with marine life: Avoid touching or handling marine animals, as they may carry harmful toxins. If you come across sea turtles, sharks, or stingrays, keep a safe distance and avoid direct contact.\n\n6. Stay hydrated: Drinking plenty of water is crucial to prevent dehydration, which can exacerbate the effects of marine toxins.\n\n7. Seek medical attention: If you suspect you have been poisoned by marine toxins, seek immediate medical attention.\n\nRemember, marine environments can be unpredictable, and it's always better to err on the side of caution to protect yourself from potential harm.\nCPU times: user 1min 2s, sys: 1.06 s, total: 1min 3s\nWall time: 1min

Wear appropriate gear: Wear a wetsuit, flippers, and a mask to protect your skin, eyes, and mouth from marine toxins.\n\n3. Stay informed: Check the weather forecast and marine conditions before heading out to the water.\n\n4. Avoid swimming in areas with high levels of marine toxins, such as near rocky shorelines or areas with high levels of algal blooms.\n\n5. Avoid eating seafood: If you are diving or swimming in contaminated waters, avoid eating seafood that may have been contaminated by marine toxins.\n\n6.
